    <P style="align-items: center;">Creating a simple to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves structuring the HTML for the list items, styling them with CSS, and adding functionality with JavaScript to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Here's a step-by-step explanation:</P>

   <li><h3>HTML Structure:</h3></li> 
First, you need to create the HTML structure for the to-do list. This will include an input field for adding new tasks, a button to submit the task, and an unordered list to display the tasks
<li><h3>CSS Structure:</h3></li> 
Next, you'll style the to-do list elements using CSS to make it visually appealing.
<li><h3>Js Structure:</h3></li> 
1.Type a task into the input field.<br>
2.Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.<br>
3.Click on a task to mark it as completed (or incomplete if already completed).<br>
You can remove tasks by deleting them manually (this feature is not implemented in this basic example).<br>
This is a basic implementation of a to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can further enhance it by adding features like task deletion, local storage integration for persistence, due dates, priorities, etc., based on your requirements.
